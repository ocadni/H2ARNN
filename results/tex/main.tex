\begin{abstract}
Generative neural networks have gained popularity for scientific and commercial applications, with Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNN) showing exceptional results in image and language generation. This work presents a physical interpretation of ARNNs by reformulating the Boltzmann distribution of binary pairwise interacting Hamiltonians into autoregressive form. The resulting ARNN architecture has weights and biases of its first layer corresponding to the Hamiltonian couplings and external fields, respectively, featuring common structures like residual connections and a recurrent architecture with a clear physical meaning. However, the exponential growth with system size of the number of parameters of the hidden layers makes its direct application unfeasible. Nevertheless, the clear physical meaning of its architecture allows to use statistical physics techniques to derive new ARNNs for specific systems. The ARNN architectures for two well-known mean-field systems, the Curie-Weiss and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick models, are derived with the latter based on the k-step replica symmetric breaking solution of Parisi. The number of parameters of these derived architectures scales polynomially with system size. They perform better than other commonly used ARNNs over a wide range of physical phase space. The connection between the Boltzmann distribution and the ARNN architecture provides a way to derive new neural networks for different interacting systems and interpret existing ones from a physical perspective.

\section{Introduction} 
The cross-fertilization between machine learning and statistical physics, in particular of disorder systems, has a long history \cite{doi:10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554, PhysRevA.32.1007}.
Recently, the development of deep neural network frameworks \cite{bengioNatureDeepLearning2015} have been applied to statistical physics problems \cite{RevModPhys.91.045002} spanning a wide range of domains, including quantum mechanics \cite{doi:10.1126/science.aag2302, Nieuwenburg2017}, 
classical statistical physics \cite{Carrasquilla2017, Wu2019}, chemical and biological physics \cite{noe2019boltzmann,jumper2021highly}.
On the other hand, techniques borrowed from statistical physics have been used to shed light on the behavior of Machine Learning algorithms \cite{doi:10.1080/00018732.2016.1211393, Nguyen2017}, and even to suggest training or architecture frameworks \cite{Chaudhari_2019, pmlr-v37-sohl-dickstein15}.
In recent years, the introduction of deep generative autoregressive models \cite{pmlr-v37-germain15, NIPS2016_b1301141}, like transformers \cite{NIPS2017_3f5ee243}, has been a breakthrough in the field, generating images and text with a quality comparable to human-generated ones \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2005.14165}.  
The introduction of deep ARNN was motivated as a flexible and general approach generating according to a probability distribution learned from data \cite{pmlr-v32-gregor14, pmlr-v15-larochelle11a, pmlr-v48-oord16}. In classical statistical physics, the ARNN was introduced, in a variational setting, to sample from a Boltzmann distribution (or equivalently from an energy model \cite{pmlr-v80-huang18d} as an improvement over the standard variational approach thanks to the high expressiveness of the ARNN architecture \cite{Wu2019}. Then similar approaches are used in different contexts, and domains of classical \cite{10.1103/physreve.101.023304,PhysRevE.101.053312,PhysRevE.103.012103,PhysRevResearch.3.L042024,10.1038/s42256-021-00401-3} and quantum statistical physics \cite{10.1103/physrevlett.128.090501,PhysRevA.102.062413,PhysRevLett.124.020503,PhysRevResearch.2.023358, Liu_2021, Barrett2022}. The ability of the ARNNs to efficiently generate samples, thanks to the ancestral sampling procedure, opened the way to overcome the slowdown of Monte-Carlo methods for frustrated or complex systems. However, recently some work questioned the real gain in very frustrated systems \cite{condmat7020038,https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.11145}.
%The main idea behind these models is to use a neural network to predict the next element in a sequence given all previous elements. 
The use of ARNNs in statistical physics problems has largely relied on pre-existing computer science architectures, which may not be well-suited for the particular problem at hand. This work aims to demonstrate how the knowledge of the model can inform the design of more effective ARNN architectures. The derivation of an exact ARNN architecture for the classical Boltzmann distribution of a general pairwise interacting Hamiltonian of binary variables will be presented. Despite the generality of the Hamiltonian, the resulting architecture displays interesting properties: the first layer parameters directly related to the Hamiltonian parameters and the emergence of residual connections and recurrent structures with clear physical interpretations.\\

The resulting deep ARNN architecture has the number of parameters of the hidden layers scaling exponentially with the system's size. 
However, the clear physical picture of the architecture allows us to use standard statistical physics techniques to find new feasible ARNN architecture for specific hamiltonian or energy models. To show the potentiality of the derived representation, the ARNN architectures for two well-known mean-field models are derived: the Curie-Weiss model (CW) and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model (SK). These fully connected models are chosen due to their paradigmatic role in the history of statistical physics systems. The CW model, despite its straightforward hamiltonian, was one of the first models explaining the behavior of ferromagnet systems, displaying a second-order phase transition \cite{kadanoff2000statistical}. In this case, an exact ARNN architecture at finite N and in the thermodynamic limit is obtained with the number of parameters scaling polynomially with the system's size.

The SK model \cite{PhysRevLett.35.1792} is a fully connected spin glass model of disorder magnetic materials. Key concepts and methods of the celebrated \cite{Nobel2021} k-step replica symmetric breaking (k-RSB) solution \cite{PARISI1979203, PhysRevLett.43.1754} of Parisi, have been applied to very different problems, like neural networks \cite{Gardner_1987, PhysRevLett.55.1530}, optimizations \cite{doi:10.1126/science.1073287}, inference problems \cite{doi:10.1080/00018732.2016.1211393}, or in characterizing the jamming of hard spheres \cite{RevModPhys.82.789, PhysRevLett.102.195701}. The complex many valley landscapes of the probability distribution captured by the k-RSB solution is the key concept that unifies the description of many different problems. In the following, I will derive an ARNN architecture for the Boltzmann distribution of the SK model for a single instance of disorder, with a finite number of variables. The derivation is based on the k-RSB solution, resulting in a deep ARNN architecture with parameters scaling polynomially with the system size. \\
            
\section{autoregressive Boltzmann distribution of pair-wise interacting Hamiltonian}

The Boltzmann probability distribution of a given Hamiltonian $H[\mathbf{x}]$ of a set of $N$ binary variables $\mathbf{x}=\{x_1, x_2,...x_N\}$ at inverse temperature $\beta$ is $P(\mathbf{x}) = \nicefrac{e^{-\beta H\left(\mathbf{x}\right)}}{Z}$. The $Z=\sum_{\mathbf{x}}e^{-\beta H\left(\mathbf{x}\right)}$ is the usually normalization factor.
It is generally challenging to compute marginals and average quantities when $N$ is large and generate samples on frustrated systems. Defining the sets of variables $\mathbf{x}_{<i}=\left(x_{1},x_{2}\dots x_{i-1}\right)$ and $\mathbf{x}_{>i}=\left(x_{i+1},x_{i+2}\dots x_{N}\right)$ respectively with an index lower and larger than $i$, then if we can rewrite the Boltzmann distribution in the autoregressive form:
$
P\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\prod_{i}P\left(x_{i}|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right),
$
it would be straightforward to produce independent samples from it, thanks to the ancestral sampling procedure \cite{Wu2019}. It has been proposed \cite{Wu2019} to use a variational approach to approximate the Boltzmann distribution with trial autoregressive probability distributions where each conditional probability is represented by a feed-forward neural network with a set of parameters ${\theta}$,
$
Q^{\theta}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\prod_{i}Q^{\theta_i}\left(x_{i}|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)
$.
The parameters ${\theta}$ can be learn minimizing the (inverse) Kullback-Leibler divergence $D_{KL}$,
with the true probability function:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
& D_{KL}\left(P|Q^{\Theta}\right) =  \sum_{\left\{ x\right\} }Q^{\Theta}\left(\mathbf{x} \right)\ln\left(\frac{Q^{\Theta}\left(\mathbf{x} \right)}{P\left(\mathbf{x} \right)}\right)  \\
& \approx \sum_{\mathbf{x}\sim Q^{\Theta}}\left[\ln\left(Q^{\Theta}\left(\mathbf{x} \right)\right)-\ln\left(P\left(\mathbf{x} \right)\right)\right]
\end{split}    
\end{equation}
Thanks to the ancestral sampling, we substituted the sum over all possible configurations with a subset extracted from the autoregressive trial functions. Usually, an annealing procedure is applied, starting with a high temperature and slowly decreasing it.
In this framework, the choice of the architecture of the neural networks is crucial to obtain a good approximation of the Boltzmann distribution.

\subsection{Conditionals}
The generic $i$-th conditional probability factor of the Boltzmann can be rewritten in this form: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:chain}
    \begin{split}
    & P\left(x_{i}|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)  = 
    \frac{P\left(\mathbf{x}_{<i+1}\right)}{P\left(\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)}  = 
    \frac{\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{>i}}P\left(\mathbf{x}\right)}{\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{>i-1}}P\left(\mathbf{x}\right)} \\
    &=\frac{\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{>i}}e^{-\beta H}}{\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{>i-1}}e^{-\beta H}}  = 
    \frac{f\left(x_{i},\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)}{\sum_{x_{i}}f\left(x_{i},\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)}.
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where I defined: $f\left(x_{i}=\pm 1,\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = \sum_{x_{i+1}\dots x_{N}}e^{-\beta H}\delta_{x_i, \pm1}$, and $\delta_{a,b}$ is the delta di Kronecker function that is one when the two values $(a,b)$ coincides and zero otherwise. Usually, in the representation of the conditional probability $P\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)$ as a feed-forward neural network, the set of variable $\mathbf{x}_{<i}$ is the input, and the sigma function $\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ is the last layer, assuring that the output is between $0$ and $1$. The probability $P\left(x_{i}=-1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = 1 - P\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)$ is straightforward to obtain. With simple algebraic manipulations, we can write: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sigma_log}
    \begin{split}
    & P\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = \frac{f\left(1,\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)}{\sum_{x_{i}}f\left(x_{i},\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)}\\
    &= \sigma\left(\log\left[f\left(1,\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)\right]-\log\left[f\left(-1,\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)\right]\right)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Consider a generic two-body interaction Hamiltonian of binary spin variables $x_i \in \{-1,1\}$, $H = -\sum_{i<j} J_{ij} x_i x_j - \sum_{i} h_i x_i$, where $J_{ij}$ are the interaction couplings and $h_i$ are the external fields. Substituting it in eq.\ref{eq:sigma_log}, we obtain:

    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{img/h2ARNN.pdf}
    \caption{Neural network Architectures of conditional probability}
    \label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:conditional_ghann}
    \begin{split}
    & P\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = \\
    & \sigma\left( 2 \beta \left(h_i + \sum_{s=1}^{i-1} J_{si} x_s\right) +\log(\rho_i^+) - \log(\rho_i^-)
    \right),   
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \rho_i^{\pm}&[\mathbf{x}_{<i}]  = \sum_{\mathbf{x}_{>i}}  \exp \bigg(
    \beta\sum_{l=i+1}^{N} x_l \sum_{s=1}^{i-1} J_{sl} x_s +\\
    &\beta\sum_{l=i+1}^{N}\big( \pm J_{il}  + h_l \big) x_l 
    + \beta\sum_{l=i+1}^{N}\sum_{l'=l+1}^{N} J_{ll'} x_l x_{l'} \bigg)
\end{split}
\label{eq:rho_ghann}
\end{equation}
The elements in $H$ that depend only on $\mathbf{x}_{<i}$, $\sum_{s=1}^{i-1} h_s x_s + \sum_{s=1}^{i-1}\sum_{s'=s+1}^{i-1} J_{ss'} x_{s} x_{s'}$, cancel out.
The conditional probability, eq.\ref{eq:conditional_ghann}, can be interpreted as a feed-forward neural network with the following architecture (see fig.\ref{fig:arch}) :
%\begin{equation}
\begin{multline}
        P_i\left(x_i=1 | \mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = 
     \sigma \bigg\{ x_i^1+ 
     \log\big[ \sum_{c} e^{b_c^+ + \sum_{l=i+1}^{N} w_{cl} x_{il}^1}\big]\\
     +\log\big[ \sum_{c} e^{b_c^- + \sum_{l=i+1}^{N} w_{cl} x_{il}^1}\big] \bigg\},
\end{multline}
%\end{equation}
where $x_i^1=\sum_{s=1}^{i-1} J_{si} x_s$ and $x_{il}^1=\sum_{s=1}^{i-1} J_{sl} x_s$ are the output of the first layer. 
Then, a second layer acts on the set of $x_{il}^1$ (see fig.\ref{fig:arch}). The $\sum_{c}$ is over the $2^{N-i}$ number of configurations of the set of $\mathbf{x}_{>i}$ variables. 
The parameters of the second layers are the $b_c^{\pm} = \beta\sum_{l=i+1}^N (\pm J_{il} + h_l + \sum_{l'=l+1}^N J_{ll'}x_{l'}) x_l $ and the $w_{cl}=x_l$, where $c$ is the index of the configuration of the set of $\mathbf{x}_{>i}$ variables. Then, the two functions $\rho^{\pm}$ are obtained by applying the non-linear operator $\log \Sigma \exp (\mathbf{x}) = \log(\sum_i e^{x_i})$ at the output of the second layer (see fig.\ref{fig:arch}). 
As the last layer, the two $\rho^{\pm}$ and $x_i^1$ are combined with the right signs, and the sigma function is applied. The whole architecture of the Boltzmann distribution of general pairwise interacting Hamiltonian of an Autoregressive Neural Network ($\text{H}_2\text{ARNN}$) is depicted in fig.\ref{fig:arch}. The total number of parameters scales exponentially with the system size, making the sampling infeasible after a few spins.
Nevertheless, the $\text{H}_2\text{ARNN}$ architecture shows some interesting futures:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The weights and biases of the first layers are the parameters of the Hamiltonian of the Boltzmann distribution.  As far as the author knows, it is the first time that a neural network architecture is proposed to represent the autoregressive Boltzmann probability distribution of a classical physical system where the weights and biases of the first layers are the parameters of the Hamiltonian. 
    \item Residual connections among layers, due to the $x_i^1$ variables, naturally emerge from the derivation. 
    The importance of residual connections appeared recently \cite{10.48550/arxiv.1512.03385} and became a crucial element in the success of the ResNet and transformer architectures \cite{vaswani2017attention}, in classification and generative tasks. They were presented as a way to improve the training of deep neural networks avoiding the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. In our context, they represent the direct interactions among the variable $x_i$ and all the previous variables $\mathbf{x}_{<i}$. 

    \item The $\text{H}_2\text{ARNN}$ is a recurrent neural network \cite{bengioNatureDeepLearning2015, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1506.00019}, similar to some AR-NN architecture used in statistical physics problems \cite{10.1038/s42256-021-00401-3, PhysRevResearch.2.023358}. 
    The first layer, see figure \ref{fig:arch}, is composed of the following set of linear operators on the input $x^1_{il}(\mathbf{x}_{<i})=\sum_{s=1}^{i-1} J_{si} x_s$ with $i<l<=N$. The set of $x_{il}$ can be rewritten in recursive form observing that:
    \begin{equation}
        x^1_{il} = x^1_{i-1,l} + J_{i-1,l} x_{i-1}
    \end{equation}
    The neurons $x^1_{il}$ in the first layer of each conditional probability in the $\text{H}_2\text{ARNN}$ architecture depend on the $x^1_{i-1,l}$ of the previous conditional probability.
\end{itemize}
%This dependence on the size of the system appears reasonable because, otherwise, it could be possible to sample to whatever pairwise hamiltonian in polynomial time, and as long we assume that $P\neq NP$ it could not be possible. 
%The computational cost of the sum over all the configuration of spins $x_l$ grows exponentially with the system's size making it unfeasible, after a few spins, the explicit computations. The idea is to find feed-forward neural network architectures representing these functions with a polynomial number of free parameters. \\
The number of parameters of the feed-forward neural network representations of the $\rho_i^{\pm}$ functions of the conditional probability of the variable $i$, eq.\ref{eq:rho_ghann}, scale exponentially with the system's size, proportionally to $2^{N-i}$. 
The functions $\rho_i^{\pm}$ take into account the effect of the interactions among $\mathbf{x}_{<i}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{>i}$ on the variable $x_i$. 
The $\rho_i^{\pm}$ function can be interpreted as the partition function of a system, where the variables are the $\mathbf{x}_{>i}$ and the external fields are determined by the values of the variables $x_{<i}$.
Starting from that observation, in the following, I will show how to use standard tools of statistical physics to derive deep AR-NN architecture that solves the exponential growth.  \\

\section{Models}
\subsection{The Curie-Weiss model}

The Curie-Weiss model (CW) is a uniform, fully-connected Ising model. The Hamiltonian, with $N$ spins, is $H\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=-h\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}-\frac{J}{N}\sum_{i<j}x_{i}x_{j}$. The conditional probability of a spin $i$, eq.\ref{eq:conditional_ghann}, of the CW model is:
\begin{multline}
P^{CW}\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = 
\sigma\bigg( 
 2 \beta h + 2 \beta \frac{J}{N}\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s} + \\
 \log(\rho_i^+[\mathbf{x}_{<i}]) - \log(\rho_i^-[\mathbf{x}_{<i}])
\bigg),
\label{eq:conditional_cw}
\end{multline}
where:
\begin{equation}
\rho_i^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}] \propto \sum_{\mathbf{x}_{>i}}e^{\beta \left(h\pm\frac{J}{N}+\frac{J}{N}\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s}\right)\sum_{l=i+1}^{N}x_{l}+\frac{\beta J}{2N}(\sum_{l=i+1}^{N}x_{l})^{2}} 
%\sum_{x_{i+1}\dots x_{N}} e^{\beta h_i^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}]S_i +\frac{\beta J}{2N}S_{i}^{2}},
\label{eq:rho_cw_0}
\end{equation}
Defining $h_i^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}] =h\pm\frac{J}{N}+\frac{J}{N}\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s}$, at given $\mathbf{x}_{<i}$, the eq. \ref{eq:rho_cw_0} is equivalent to the partition function of a CW model, with $N-i$ spins and external fields $h_i^{\pm}$. 
As shown in the Appendix, the summations over $\mathbf{x_{i>}}$ can be easily done, finding the following expression:

 \begin{eqnarray*}
 \rho_i^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-i} e^{a_{i,k}^{\pm} + b_{i,k}^{\pm} \sum_s x_s} 
\end{eqnarray*}
where we defined:
\begin{align}
\label{eq:params}
\begin{split}
b_{i,k}^{\pm} & = \log\left(\binom{N-i}{k}\right) + \frac{\beta J}{2N}\left(N-i-2k\right)^{2}+ \\
& \qquad \left(N-i-2k\right)\left(\beta h \pm \frac{\beta J}{N}\right)
\end{split} \\
\omega_{i,k}^{\pm} & = \frac{\beta J}{N}\left(N-i-2k\right).
\label{eq:CW_params}
\end{align}
The final feed-forward architecture of the Curie-Weiss Autoregressive Neural Network (CW-ARNN) architecture is:
\begin{multline*}
%\label{eq:curie_weiss_cond}
P^{CW}\left(x_{i}=+1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right)  =   \sigma \bigg[b_{0}+\omega_{0}\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s}\\
-\log\big(\sum_{k=0}^{N-i}e^{b_{i,k}^{+} + 
w_{i,k}^{+}\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s}}\big)+\log\big(\sum_{k=0}^{N-i}e^{b_{i,k}^{-} + w_{i,k}^{-}\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s}}\big)\bigg],
\end{multline*}
where $b^0=2\beta h$, $\omega^0_i = \frac{2\beta J}{N}$ are the same, and so shared, among all the conditional probability functions, see fig.\ref{fig:CW_arch }. Their parameters have an analytic dependence from the parameters $J$ and $h$ of the Hamiltonian of the systems. 
%The set of parameters ($b_i, b_i^{k\pm}, \omega_i, \omega_i^{k\pm}$) can be consider as free parameters trained to minimize the KL divergence with the true probability distribution. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering 
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{img/CW_arch.pdf}
    \caption{Neural network Architectures of the conditional probability of the CW model.}
    \label{fig:CW_arch}
\end{figure}

It is interesting to note the number of parameters of the CW-ARNN is $2+4(N-i)$; they decrease as $i$ increases. This result is, somehow, the opposite of what the neural network architecture usually should take care of, meaning increasing the number of input variables, the number of parameters should also increase to describe the complexity of the function. Still, it is compatible with what was derived for the general case, where the number of parameters needed for the $\rho^{\pm}$ decreases, in that case exponentially, with the index $i$. The CW-ARNN depends only on the sum of the input variables.
The total number of parameters of whole conditional probability distribution scales as $2N^2+ O(N)$. \\
If we consider the thermodynamical limit, $N \gg 1$, the architecture of the CW model, $\text{CW}_{\infty}$, simplify:
\begin{equation*}
    %\label{eq:curie_weiss_cond2}
    P^{CW_{\infty}}\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) =  \sigma \left(b^0+\omega_{i}^0\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s} + \omega_i^1 \text{sgn}(\sum_{s=1}^{i-1}x_{s})\right).
\end{equation*}
where $b^0=2\beta h$, $\omega^0_i = \frac{2\beta J}{N}$ are the same, and so shared, among all the conditional probability functions. The $\omega^1_i = -2\beta J |m_i|$ is different for each of them, and $m_i$ is the solution of the following equation:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{m_i N}{N-1} = \tanh \left( \beta(\frac{m_i N}{N - i} - \frac{m_{\beta}N}{N-i}) \right)
    \label{eq:extrem_i}
    \end{equation}
where $m_{\beta}$ is the average magnetization of the CW systems at inverse temperature $\beta$, see Appendix for details. In practice, the set of $\omega^1_i$ are the variational parameters to be learned during the training. The total number of parameters of the $\text{CuWANN}_{\infty}$ scale as $N+2$.
    

\subsection{The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model}
The SK hamiltonian, with zero external fields for simplicity, is given by:
\begin{equation}
H\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=-\sum_{i<j}J_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}
\end{equation}
where the set of $\underline{J}$ are i.i.d. random variable extracted from a Gaussian probability distribution $P(J)=\sqrt{\frac{N}{2\pi}}\exp\left(\frac{-NJ^2}{2} \right)$. \\
To find a feed-forward representation of the conditional probability of its Boltzmann distribution, we use the replica trick \cite{10.1142/0271} that, usually, is applied together with the average over the system's disorder. In our case, we work on a single instance of the set of $Js$, but I will assume that $N-i$ is large enough such that the following approximation hold for the $\rho_i^{\pm}$ functions: 
\[
\log\rho_i^{\pm} \sim \mathbb{E}\left[  \log\rho_i^{\pm} \right] = \lim_{n\rightarrow 0} \frac{  \log(\mathbb{E}\left[(\rho_i^{\pm})^n \right])}{n}
\]
In the last equality, we use the replica trick. 
For each specific conditional probability, the average over the disorder $\mathbb{E}$ is taken on the coupling parameters $J_{ll'}$ with $l,l'>i$. Implicitly, we assume that the quantities $\log\rho_i^{\pm}$ are a self-averaged quantity on the $\mathbf{x}_{i>}$ variables.
 The replica computation can be carried on easily, finding:
\begin{multline}
\mathbb{E}_{\underline{J}}\left[(\rho_i^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}])^n \right]  = 
\int \prod_{l<l'} dP_{J_{ll'}} \bigg\{ 
\sum_{\{\underline{x}^{a}\}_{i+1}^N} \exp\bigg[\\ \beta \bigg( 
\sum_{l,a}\bigg( \pm J_{il}  
+ \sum_{s} J_{sl} x_s \bigg) x_l^{a} + 
\sum_{l,l', a} J_{ll'} x_l^{a} x_{l'}^{a}
\bigg)  \bigg] 
\bigg\}
\end{multline}
where, the sums over $(l,l')$, $s$ and $a$ run respectively over $(i+1,N)$, $(1,i-1)$ and $(1,n)$, and $dP_{J_{ll'}}=P(J_{ll'})dJ_{ll'}$. Defining $h_l^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}] =\pm J_{il} + \sum_{s=1}^{i-1} J_{sl} x_s$ as an external field, we can observe that the above quantity is the partition function a classical SK model with external fields $h_l^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}]$, at fixed $\mathbf{x}_{<i}$ and $J_{ll'}$ as coupling constants of the variables $\mathbf{x}_{i>}$.  
Computing the integrals over the disorder, we find: 
\begin{widetext}
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}_{\underline{J}}\left[(\rho_i^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}])^n \right]
& \propto  
\sum_{\{\underline{x}^{a}\}_{i+1}^N} 
\exp\left\{\beta \left[
\sum_{l} h_l^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}] \sum_{a} x_l^{a} +\frac{\beta}{2N} \sum_{a<b} \left( \sum_{l}  x_l^{a} x_l^{b} \right)^2 \right]  \right\}\\
& \propto  \int \prod_{a<b} dQ_{ab} e^{-\frac{N}{2}\beta^2Q_{a,b}^2}
\prod_{l} \left[
\sum_{\{\underline{x}^{a}_l\}} 
\exp\left\{\beta \left[
h_l^{\pm}[\mathbf{x}_{<i}] \sum_{a} x_l^{a} +\beta \sum_{a<b} Q_{a,b}  x_l^{a} x_l^{b} \right]  \right\}
\right]
\end{align}
\end{widetext}
where in the last line we used the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to linearize the quadratic terms. 
The Parisi solutions of the SK model prescribe how to parametrize the matrix of the overlaps $\{Q_{a,b}\}$ \cite{10.1142/0271}. The easiest way to parametrize the overlaps is the replica symmetric solutions (RS), where the overlaps are symmetric under permutations: 
$$
Q_{a,b}=\begin{cases}
			0, & \text{if $a=b$}\\
            q, & \text{otherwise}
		 \end{cases},
$$
Then a sequence of better approximations can be obtained by breaking, by step, the replica symmetry, from the 1-step replica symmetric breaking (1-RSB) to the infinite limit of the k-step replica symmetric breaking (k-RSB) solutions. 
The sequence k-RSB approximations can be seen as nested non-linear operations \cite{Parisi_1980}, see Appendix for details.

    \label{fig:SK_arch}
\end{figure}

Every k-step replica symmetric breaking solution leads to adding a gaussian integral and two more free variational parameters to the representation of the $\rho^{\pm}$ functions. 
In the following, we will use a feed-forward representation that enlarges the space of parameters, using a more computationally friendly non-linear operator. 
Numerical evidence of the goodness of the approximation used is shown in the Appendix. 
Overall, the parametrization of the overlaps matrix allows to perform the sum over all the configuration of the variables $\mathbf{x}_{i>}$ getting rid of the exponential scaling with the system's size of the number of parameters. 
The final AR-NN architecture of the SK model $\text{SK-ARNN}$ is: 
\begin{multline}
    Q^{\text{RS/k-RSB}}\left(x_{i}=1|\mathbf{x}_{<i}\right) = \sigma\bigg( 
        x_i^1(\mathbf{x}_{<i}) \\
        +\log(\rho_i^{+, \text{(RS/kRSB)}}) -
         \log(\rho_i^{-, \text{(RS/kRSB)}})
    \bigg)  
\end{multline}
Where for RS and 1-RSB cases the architectures are:
\begin{align*}
    \log \rho^{\pm, RS} & = \sum_{l^{\pm}=i+1}^{N}  w_0^{i,l^+} \log \sigma(b_1^{i,l^{\pm}} +
w_1^{i,l^{\pm}} x_{i,l^{\pm}}^1(\mathbf{x}_{<i})) \\
\begin{split}
    \log \rho^{\pm, 1RSB} & = 
    \sum_{l^{\pm}=i+1}^{N}  w_0^{i,l^{\pm}} \log\sigma(b_1^{i,l^{\pm}} + \\
    &  w_1^{i,l^{\pm}} \log\sigma(b_2^{i,l^{\pm}} +  w_2^{i,l^{\pm}}  x_{i,l^{\pm}}^1(\mathbf{x}_{<i}))) 
    \end{split}
\end{align*}
Where $x_{i,l^{\pm}}^1(\mathbf{x}_{<i})$ is the output of the first layer of the AR-NN, see eq. , and $(w_0^{i,l^{\pm}}, b_1^{i,l^{\pm}}, w_1^{i,l^{\pm}}, b_2^{i,l^{\pm}}, w_2^{i,l^{\pm}})$ are the free variational parameters of the AR-NN, see fig.\ref{fig:SK_arch}. The number of parameters of a single conditional probability distribution scales as $2(k+1)(N-i)$ where $k$ is the level of the k-RSB solution used, assuming $k=0$ as the RS solution.

This section shows the results of comparisons between generative neural network architectures in learning the SK and CW models. 
%Moreover, the ability to recover the hamiltonian coupling parameters from Monte-Carlo-generated instances is presented. 
The $CW$, $CW_{\infty}$ and $SK_{RS/k-RSB}$ architectures are compared with: a single variable net, $1Par$, where, for each conditional probability, a single weight parameter is multiplied to the sums of the input variable, and then the sigma function is applied. This architecture was already used for the CW system in \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.11145}. Then the Single Layer (SL) architecture, where a fully connected single linear layer parametrizes the whole probability distribution, where a mask is applied to a subset of the weights in order to preserve the autoregressive properties. The width of the layer is $N$, and the total number of parameters scale as $N^2$. Finally, I consider the MADE architecture \cite{pmlr-v37-germain15}, an extension to deep neural networks of the SL architecture. In this case, the whole probability distribution is represented with a deep sequence of fully connected layers, with non-linear activation functions and masks in between them, to assure the autoregressive properties and enhance the expressive power. The MADE$_{dw}$ used has $d$ number of hidden layers, each of them with width $w$ times the number of input variable $N$. For instance, the SL architecture is equivalent to the MADE$_{11}$ and MADE$_{23}$ has two hidden fully-connected layers, each of them of width $3*N$. 
The ARR-NN framework presented is a variational approach and in general, the variational free energy $F^{Q} =  \sum_{\mathbf{x}} Q^{\theta}(\mathbf{x})(\beta E(\mathbf{x}) + \log(Q^{\theta}(\mathbf{x}))) > F$ is an upper bound of the true one. In our case, the sum over all the configurations in the computation of the variational free energy is substituted by an estimation of the variational free energy with 20K configurations sampled from the autoregressive neural network.
The training procedure was the same for all the experiments unless conversely specified; starting from $\beta=0.1$ it reached $\beta=2.0$ with a step of $0.05$. The training was performed with a batch size of $2000$ samples and $1000$ epochs for each temperature, with a learning rate of $0.001$, and the ADAM algorithm for the optimization of the ARNN parameters. The code was written using the PyTorch framework \cite{NEURIPS2019_bdbca288}, and the code to reproduce the results is open source \cite{mygithub}.
The first layers of $CW_{\infty}$ and $SK_{RS/k-RSB}$ are fixed by the hamiltonian parameters, and for the $CW$ all the parameters are fixed and pre-calculated, see eq.\ref{eq:CW_params}.\\
The results on the CW model, with $J=1$ and $h=0$, are shown in fig.\ref{fig:curie_weiss}. 
The plots A1, A2, and A3, in the first row, show the relative error of the free energy, with respect to the exact one, computed analytically \cite{kadanoff2000statistical}, for different system sizes $N$. 
The free energy computed from samples generated with CW$_N$ architecture does not have an appreciable difference with the analytic solution, and the CW$_{\infty}$ improves as the system size increases. The fig.\ref{fig:curie_weiss}.B plots the error in the free energy estimation for the architectures with fewer parameters, 1Par and CW$_{\infty}$ (both scaling linearly with the system's size); It shows clearly that a deep architecture, in this case with only one more parameter, improves of orders of magnitude the accuracy. The need for deep architectures, already on a simple model as the CW, is indicated by the worst performance of the SL net, despite its scaling of parameters as $N^2$, has performances similar to the 1Par architecture. The MADE architecture obtains good results but was not comparable to the CW$_N$, even though having higher numbers of parameters. The plot in fig.\ref{fig:curie_weiss}(c) shows the distribution of the overlaps $q_{\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}}=\sum_{i} a_i b_i$ of the samples generated by the ARNNs. The distribution is computed at $\beta=1.3$ for $N=200$. It can be seen as the worst performance of the 1-layer networks (1par, SL) is due to the difficulty of correctly represents the configurations with magnetization different than zero in the proximity of the phase transition. This could be due to some mode collapse problems \cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2210.11145}, which does not afflict the other deep AR-NN architectures tested.

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:SK}, the result of the SK model, with $J=1$ and $h=0$ are shown; as before in the first row there is the relative error in the estimation of the free energy at different system sizes. In this case, the exact solution, for a single instance of disorder and a finite $N$ is not known. The free energy estimation of the SK-ANN$_{2-RSB}$ was taken as reference and  the relative difference computed from it. The free energy estimation of SK-ANN$_{k-RSB}$ with $k=1,2$ are very close to each other.
%, confirming the fact that the difference in free energy is very small between the 1-RSB all the subsequent k-RSB solutions \cite{Parisi_1980}. 
The performance KS-ARNN$_{RS}$ net is the same as the SL architecture even with a much higher number of parameters. The MADE architecture tested, even with a similar number of parameters of the SK-ANN$_{k-RSB}$ net, see fig.\ref{fig:SK}.C, estimate a smaller free energy, with the difference increasing with $N$. Observing the overlaps distribution in the glassy phase between the samples generated by the ARNNs, fig.\ref{fig:SK}.D, we can check as the distribution generated by the ANN$_{k-RSB}$ is higher in the region between the pick and zero overlaps, testifying that these architectures better capture the complex landscape of probability distribution \cite{PhysRevLett.51.1206}.

The final test for the derived SK-ARNN architecture involves evaluating the ability to recover the Hamiltonian coupling of the system using only samples extracted from the Boltzmann distribution of a single instance of the SK model. 10,000 samples were produced using the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm, and the SK-ARNN${1-RSB}$ was trained to minimize the log-likelihood computed on these samples. According to the derivation of the SK-ARNN${1-RSB}$ architecture, the widths of the first layer of the neural network should correspond to the coupling parameters of the Hamiltonian. As shown in Fig.\ref{fig:SK_MC}, there is a strong correlation between the weights of the first layer and the coupling Hamiltonian, even though the neural network was trained in an over-parameterized setting; it has 60,000 parameters, significantly more than the number of samples (10,000).

\section{Conclusions}
In this study, the exact architecture of the ARNN for a pairwise interacting system Hamiltonian (H$_2$-ARNN) was derived. The H$_2$-ARNN is a deep neural network, with the weights and biases of the first layer corresponding to the coupling and external field of the Hamiltonian, respectively. The derivation of H$_2$-ARNN results in a recurrent structure and skip-connections with a clear physical interpretation. Unfortunately, the H$_2$-ARNN is not directly usable due to the exponential increase in the number of hidden layer parameters with the size of the system. However, the clear physical interpretation of the H$_2$-ARNN allows for the application of statistical physics techniques to derive tractable architectures for specific problems. For example, it was demonstrated how to derive architectures with parameters that scale polynomially with the system size for the CW and SK models. In the case of the SK model, the architecture was derived based on  the sequence of improved approximate k-step replica symmetric breaking solutions, which were mapped to a sequence of deeper ARNNs architectures.

The derived ARNNs architectures were tested on both the Curie-Weiss and SK models and the results indicate that they outperform standard architectures commonly used in the literature in reproducing the system's free energy. Furthermore, the close connection between the physics of the problem and the neural network architecture was utilized in the reverse direction, as demonstrated in the results section. In this case, an SK-ANN architecture was trained on samples generated from the Boltzmann distribution of a SK model and the weights of the first layer were found to have a strong correlation with the coupling parameters of the Hamiltonian.

Despite the fact that the derivation of a simple and compact ARNN architecture is not always feasible for all types of pairwise interactions and exact solvable physical systems are rare, the clear physical interpretation provides a means to derive approximate architectures for specific Boltzmann distributions. \\
In this work, while the ARNN architecture of an SK model was derived, its learnability was not thoroughly examined. The problem of finding the configurations of minimum energy for the SK model is known to belong to the NP-HARD class, and the effectiveness of the ARNN approach in solving this problem is still uncertain and a matter of ongoing research \cite{}. Further systematic study is needed to fully understand the learnability of the ARNN architecture presented in this work at very low temperature and also on different systems.\\

There are several promising directions for future research to expand upon presented ARNN architectures. For instance, the architecture, for models with more state variables, such as Potts models, could be derived. This is the setting of recent language generative models, like the transformer architecture. Another direction could be to consider systems with interactions beyond pairwise, to describe more complex probability distributions. Additionally, it would be interesting to examine not fully connected models but sparse ones, such as systems that interact on a grid or a random sparse graph. The first case is fundamental for a large number of physics systems and image generation task, while the latter type, such as Erdos-Renyi interaction graphs, is common in many optimization and inference problems.
